            Footvolley is a sport which combines aspects of
            beach volleyball and association football. <br>
            Footvolley was created by Octavio de Moraes in 1965 in Brazil.<br>
            Footvolley combines field rules that are based on those of beach volleyball 
            with ball-touch rules taken from association football.
